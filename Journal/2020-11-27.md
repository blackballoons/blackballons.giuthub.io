Not going out for run [[Non-running days]]

the reason (or excuse) for not going for run today. 
1. bad air (reason)
2. mask  (excuse)
3. soreness (reason/excuse)

B was worried and I was as well. So I told him I would do yoga instead. 

I originally thought I would do yoga for 90 min because that would square off the time that would usually take for me to run. But it got boring and bit difficult and I started searching for running routes. And think I found reasonable one. Up near the back of the palace and back. It would be good to try that one. I could have done so today (guess its not too late) but was reluctant 

I think in the [[Aspiration]] I would like to have a [[#dream house]] with a dedicated exercise room with a running machine, rowing machine and a good yoga mat. 

oh I think I will get yoga mat today [[get list]] something portable so I can carry it wherever I go. 

I need #occupation.

todo for today
- [ ] start doing CBT again
- [ ] go for a walk
- [ ] start writing more

- let's just go for run daily, mood change is too definite 
- I think I just better run. running in the bad air is bad, but depression is worse. I feel like a genuinely different person. much subdued and unhappy.


I got up early. 
read a book.
didn't go for run. 
did a bit of yoga instead.
ate sweet potatos and boild eggs. drank almond milk and ate some fruit. 
was much subdued and less happy. 
wrote some notes. 
Decided on what my general schedule should be. 
read a bit of wiki page. read a bit of spanish articles 

*how differently I feel*
This I notice mostly towards B. I am all that I think and feel so I don't really notice this towards myself unless I'm severely depressed. 

case in point : yesterday I was full of love and good humor towards B. Today I feel unsympathetic towards what he does and his presence if not outright irritated. 

	#Running is simply fundamental for me. I really can negate it because I feel like a totally different person when I don't run. And the one who runs is the one I feel that I am and who I should be. 
	
	there are definitely good excuses but I think even if the benefit is undermined I should go for a run without question* because #depression is without a question* worse. When I don't go for a run it is a whole different day/days/life of a whole different person that I get thrown in.
