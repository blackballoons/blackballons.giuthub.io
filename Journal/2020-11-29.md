the running group meetup was good. I came back pretty tired and hungry. think I should have eaten something more in hindsight. 
went to Persian Palace, B just gobbling up and I got annoyed. Although the meal great I came back pretty sore psychologically. Need to unfold where the unpleasantness really coming from. I feel unpleasantness and not sure it is sorely because of B's bad manner. 
I have muscle soreness but not sure if it's really about that. BTW I'm still fully going for the run tomorrow. If B goes to night out tomorrow my challenge would be keep MY routine undisturbed and I'm fully committed to doing that. I would also 
- call Chinmay
- make dentist appointment
- call Eunjeong about postponing meeting up to Sat


finished watching the second section of the tutorial. I was tempted to quite early but I didn't so that's good. 
It is pretty fun so far but the crux would be continue on even when I feel less so since I do want to continue on. 
rather tired. but I had a good day with some hiccups. I know what to do and even if unexpected happens, I can deal with it I'm sure. 

I missed some events that I Did want to go because of recent ruts that I felt into. But I'm determined to forge my ways forward and achieving my goals and reaching for better self. 

I'm not fragile. I might mistakes but I'm resilient
