I'm so far enjoying this note app. 

Had a good morning run. Although I was tired the moon, nightscape and the sunrise were very beautiful and the podcast I was listening to were interesting. 
I also thought about how constructive and pleasant it is and would be to focus more on the positives. 
Came back, took a shower, talked to B. had some breakfast.

B said something about *'beginning to see the outline of the life I'm interested in'*  I really liked how he phrased it and the sentiment behind it. 

I'm continuing to watch and learn about python. I'm very pleased with the introduction of this new line of studying and occupying. I think it is good direction and feel more determined. 
I also made an appointment with the dentist. Doing something I have been postponing also made me feel better. 

finished quite view videos. feel good about it. was snacking as I was watching it but since we didn't have a seat down proper meal today, this doesn't feel much disordered. 

the destination and the schedule of the next trip is set now. going to bath. also set the date for meeting up with mum. 
at least it's gonna be interesting. 
b is struggling a bit with the chair situation. when we come back to Korea we will start making long term arrangement and that will be fun. 

I still think about now and then I might be fully in the stable ground, but rather than thinking about what might go wrong knowing that I am capable of bouncing back and that I'm resilient.
