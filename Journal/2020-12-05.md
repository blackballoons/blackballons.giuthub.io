atm I feel quite bad. I overate, compare to yesterday today feels disorderly and lame. 

hate the sight of B and feel stuck and cramped. 

I know that this is just a phase and the one that I can quite easily change. I should break the day like with a walk (outdoor, sun) and also eat at certain time not constantly. Knowing the fix, important thing is to execute it. 

I find it very difficul to stop eating. Eating ordrly and not eating whilst doing something is what I really should walk on.
