I've done not so well for sometimes maybe longer maybe shorter, maybe none at all and it could get lot worse or maybe the way I evaluate is not good (that it's unhelpful). Whatever or however, the future stands and it will be. What I can do is to put myself there with my best foot forward. step by step decision after decision building memory to perceive the self and the world. 

Maybe it is the case that reaching certain age, it really is mostly POV. Because there has been enough foundation and construction projects failed or successful, it is just how or what we choose to look the self and the world as.
