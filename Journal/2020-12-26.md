## Positive 
great run. food. snack. sight. things are good. start to feel motivated about the job 

start to feel worried but that would be great source of motivation. with 2021 beginning I could step up for the better future. stress is often gonna be a part of the change but since change is gonna be part of life I might as well take it in the best attitude and run with it as a great source of motivation to better myself and my lot.

Another great edition from Bath. It was a chilly rainy day as prophesied and assumed by everyone. Started the journey with Louix Threou podcast Ruby Wax interview. It was a weird and interesting one as per. The canal was scenic and the wood burning smell comforting, the run felt cozy and loungy; but then I started listening the latest episode of This American Life, which had a story about firefighting. The coziness of the smoke took some complexity from then. Initially, I intended to run along the canal as much as I can but monotony woke up tiredness a bit so I diverted to Monkton Comb which is a quaint and posh little village. Passing by the village I moved on to a different cycle path and passed by Midport station and Midport castle. Both disused and interesting. Then I saw a bull finch which I've never seen before. Things were getting exciting. Then I reached my favorite point, the tunnel. I had my playlist ready.
