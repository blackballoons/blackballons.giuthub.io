As my laptop came into life and the screen light shone on my thoughts scurried in fright.
There was nothing unusual about this annoying ritual, but this time it felt particularly like a betrayal because I had an impression that my thought and I had reached a pretty significant life lesson during the last horrendous week. 
So my thoughts running away as if in denial of my experience if not my existence hurt my feeling a great deal. 

my thoughts love the darkness, that's why it becomes extraordinarily loud and bold when I shut my eyes to sleep. I think it also doesn't like light because quite many of them are the festering kinds. Light stops the growth of festering thoughts and they are not on board with that. 
So when I open my laptop and the light from the screen passes the retinas of my eyes my thoughts scatter like uninvited guests they are. 


# Sickness
I was tired for sure but I didn't realize how sick I was until I was already there. I knew I was sick because I wasn't running but I wasn't eating, it was alarming but I was already sick so there was nothing to be done. This physical sickness lasted for 3 days. 
I thought I was OK by day 2 so I slept in the same room as my partner (I slept on the sofa the day before just in case.) But as I was sleeping on the bed my partner kept waking me up to tell me how warm I was (which was great help because I needed to know that more than to get good sleep.) And the thermometer reported that I have temperature nearing 39 C. So when the fever didn't go down that day B signed me up for a covid test. 


# Sleepless nights 
I was feeling better except the fever but the fact that I was getting the test just depressed me enormously. Me being in UK and not being able to go back, being stuck with unsympathetic partner, I felt trapped and it was my fault. Thoughts, the nastiest ones, were filling up my head and my episode started. I couldn't stop the thoughts and it was getting worse. I knocked on the bedroom door and said I can't sleep alone because things were bad. My partner offered to sleep on the sofa. I broke. I cried on the bed a bit (he didn't vacate the bed.) and left for the sofa again. I cried for couple of hours more and gave up sleeping. I watched It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. It really is a great show. When the morning came I went out and got the test. And until I got the result the evening after I didnt' sleep and watched It's Always ... My temperature had gone down and I could feel that I was recovering except that now I was sleep deprived and depressed. 

# Separation
I got the negative results. But now I was just plain depressed and did not want to be in the same space as B. 

# Stale mates
