Dentist often coincide with bad affect and I notice myself rather wary of that. It often cause me fear related to money, pain, and guilt (about how I'm at times bad with managing self and control). But postponing because of the fear would not only solve the issue but would exacerbate it. And regret would serve me none, so what I would do is to make an appointment for next Tuesday (because I want to maintain habit of studying CS regularly) but would call and make appointment for the Tuesday. Also, another thing I've been postponing is to call an insurance company which is really is just nothing. I should just thank my luck star that those are my most pressing worries. 

If another thing comes up with dentist I would deal with as it needed. One good thing is that if something is need to be done. It just needs to be done and that's it. I might consider postponing if need be or make claim of mal practice if needs be but I would just as it appears and there is nothing to fret because as with the regret nothing can really be changed by that only cause me stress.
