- goal: let's write a post abot today(what I'd learn, or a short story)

- wrote: short snippets on twitter.

- research:
1. newsletter scene
   checked out substack but it is not for making a living.
2. birding community. Korean birding, birding tour scene.
   went to the fatbirdir website and from there variou birding websites for various countries. Very well organized niche group, birdirs are. But can't find what kind of opportunity there could be. Korea does have little to no birding tour for international twitchers but is there anything there?

- notable event: was offered a cadbury egg as a joke and was pissed off royally, still am.

- thought pattern: angry. resentful. hate-filled. little distructive.
  also noticed that I feel no sympathy. what have I become? hatred and anger is a scary thing that change a person from inside out. It doesn't take much to become something like a monster if one has much anger and no sympathy.
