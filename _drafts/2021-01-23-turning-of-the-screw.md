Adult drinks, but adult also screw the cap back on.

I don't remember what the scene was about, but I do remember Reese Witherspoon screwing the cap all the way back on.

I guess she was drinking in the scene. She must have unscrewed the bottle - poured a drink - and screw the top back on.  

It was fascinating.

When it comes to drinking, my team of researchers tells me that the minimum action required is to open(unscrew) a container, get the liquid out and into your system. And what is not strictly required is screwing the cap the way back on, not to mention screwing it *all* the way back.(especially if you happen to be an actor drinking in a tv show)

But that would mean *leaving a bottle open*.

My theory is that Reese Witherspoon wouldn't have been OK with leaving a bottle unclosed; and quite sizable number of audience would have been driven mad by the presence of an open bottle.  
We can suspense our belief only so much. Even in la-la land, being an adult means that you take responsibility for any spilliage. We live a leaky existence. And being an adult means that we clean the mess we made. 
And I think that is why many among us would be distracted by an open bottle, and shout at a screen "look at the road!" if a driver is talking in a *tv show*.  If evolutionary force has conditioned us to like sugar, sex and social connection; taught us to fear spilling of liquid  Because when you have spilled enough liquid, fear of real-life consequences becomes a knee-jerk response.
