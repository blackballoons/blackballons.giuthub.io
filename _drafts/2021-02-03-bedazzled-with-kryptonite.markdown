I was going to write about how crystallized ginger has ruined me and revealed itself as my kryptonite. Then I remembered the pre-existing warrant I issued for mint humbug, Lindt 70% dark chocolate, as well as ginger bread, mince pie, chocolate pudding...

If the historical account is to be believed, my world has been increasingly bedazzled with kryptonites. It's not easy to keep a straight face blaming the world; but I try. I tried spinning the complaints as the proof of my resilience, for subjecting myself to frequent kryptonite exposure. And I also made comments about how the world and they (whoever they are) prey on bon vivant like me. In short, I tried all but making an appointment with the dentist.
