Aphra likes to read a good story, Aphra was adamant on that. 
"It has to be good." She put down her cup to make her point absolutely clear. 
"I don't like any of those low quality stuff on the paper if you know what I mean."
Roy didn't know what she meant, but did know not to take the bait. HE was adamant on that he shouldn't stay in this cozy room any second longer. The house smelled like a combination of flower, wool, and mint; it was beyond him to decide if he liked the smell or not.

 Roy didn't want to take a seat in the first place; but after living in a quaint little Irish town for last six month, the critical thinking ability of his arse was not what it used to be.
 
 "Yes, you are very right. I understand. All I want is your consent saying that I can tell Lucy's story and use some of these photos."
 Fanning the photos of Aphra and her Irish shepherd like a magician doing card trick Roy became embarrassed.
