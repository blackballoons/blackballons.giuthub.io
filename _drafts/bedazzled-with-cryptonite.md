I was about to solipsize about how crystalized ginger is my cryptonite. Then I realized  I'd already given the title to mint humbug. Also.. didn't I said something similar about Lindor 70% dark chocolate? as well as ginger bread, mince pie, chocolate pudding...

The truth is, so many food items have been called my cryptonites the market is flooded. And I can not in good conscience give out the title like this any more. Maybe it is a testement to my resilience, subjecting myself to frequent cryptonite exposure as such. Or it denotes my bon vivant nature. It is also possible that I need to schedule an appointment with the dentist asap.
