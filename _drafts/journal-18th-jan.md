I should run a bit tomorrow. not too much just a short one. yeap yeap yeap yeap.

ok. I need to start running again. right?
I have an idea.
instead of running two hours daily.
I need to start running just an hour.
that would be much better than current trajectory of non-moving what so ever.

my routine has broken down great deal and it was shaky quite often recently as well.

so what I've got to do instead of fumbling badly is to start out establishing it again. **start out small and build.**

*building it back would be easier and quite more realistic than pushing it when the motivation is already pretty depleted.*

so **my goal is to just run an hour every day instead of 2hr journeys.**

an hour everyday would be good enough and it would be easy for me to build back up again!

and let's stop regretting about what should have been. I do need to focus on the future (especially when the present looks bleak) and regretting would only drag me down further.
