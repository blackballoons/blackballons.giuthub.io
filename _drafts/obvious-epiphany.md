## TL;DR
for lifestyle choices and premeditated decision

1. Past-self makes decision for the future-self
2. Present-self doesn't get say about the decision made by the past-self

I need to make decision for future self and obey that decision. My present self should accept that she does not get any vote and there is no other options.
