## thoughts

in the arena of competing modality that is life
want ranks the lowest when can, will, need is competing for the power and responsibility of one's entire existence.

## tomorrow

- I will run in the morn (possibly a different route)
- take a bath
- write about the run (maybe with some accompanying pics)
- look at portfolio building stuff
- read articles in Chinese
- write about how I feel and my plans

## my goals
- start **running** again
- keep **writing** and logging about my running, learning, reading, writing routines (in a daily post)
- **reading** a specific book and finish it
- **learning** specific disciple like language (Chinese, Spanish *in an organized manner with logging progress*) or programming
- and also logging my specific plans in short, long term
