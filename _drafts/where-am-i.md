I'm in self quarantine, in a high rise in Bucheon, a city only technically outside of Seoul, Korea. I'm in good relations with my people (fiancee, friends, family). I'm in my 30s since 2020.

I was in UK for last several months for a reason looked very good at the time.

I was in an impression that I would *find myself* given enough time. Now I'm in the opinion either the idea of finding oneself is destructive aphorism or there isn't enough time in the universe.
