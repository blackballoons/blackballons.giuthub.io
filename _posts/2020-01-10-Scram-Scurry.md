As my laptop came into life and the screen light shone on my thoughts scurried in fright.
There was nothing unusual about this annoying ritual, but this time it felt particularly like a betrayal because I had an impression that my thought and I had reached a pretty significant life lesson during the last horrendous week. 
So my thoughts running away as if in denial of my experience if not my existence hurt my feeling a great deal. 

my thoughts love the darkness, that's why it becomes extraordinarily loud and bold when I shut my eyes to sleep. I think it also doesn't like light because quite many of them are the festering kinds. Light stops the growth of festering thoughts and they are not on board with that. 
So when I open my laptop and the light from the screen passes the retinas of my eyes my thoughts scatter like uninvited guests they are.
