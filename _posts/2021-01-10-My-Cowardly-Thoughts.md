The light came on the screen, my thoughts scurried in fright.
My thoughts' craven behavior should have been foreseen, since it was the norm by this point, but not only it still stung, this time it felt particularly like a betrayal because I had an impression that my thought and I had been through something significant during the last horrendous week.
So my thoughts running away as if in denial of that experience if not my existence felt very much like a betrayal and hurt my feeling a great deal.

It was obvious from early on how my thoughts love the darkness, which explains why they are so loud and bold when I'm about to go to sleep. It also mattered that they are quite often the festering kinds. Since light stops their unhealthy propagation, my thoughts are not keen on the exposure.
