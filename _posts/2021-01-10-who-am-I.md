# who am I ?
I am not
- a politician
- a nurse
- a dog

It took me YEARS to figure out that I am none of the above, ~~so you don't have to.~~ You are welcome.

# more clues

I like reading the back of packaging materials.
I save leaflets from travel attractions for bedtime reading.
One of my greatest joy when little was rummaging through the drawers of relative we were visiting.

# what happened?
I was only trying to help, but that dog was a bitch.
