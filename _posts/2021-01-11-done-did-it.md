Done did pretty bad today. Overeating and eating some more. Day started with eggs and not the run. Pretty lamentable but I also started with unhealthy dose of regrets instead of getting on with the future. So tomorrow I will focus on the future and the now instead of mulling and dulling the past and the present.
