I remember hiding behind reefs to eavesdrop on what other mermaids were saying about the disease. Although any one of us could catch it, I didn't feel confident enough to worry with others. But the general dread was palpable like the current.

First it was a friend of a friend, whose cousin lost their tail and grew legs after coming back from Pacific. A couple of weeks later it was one of my cousin, then a friend, until my brother's tail started to split. We were barely dealing with the dismal new normal as it was. First they closed 'borders' then this mysterious disease was taking our tails and making us look like them.

When 'the change' came into effect, we couldn't even think of a way to respond to the so-called 'plan'. The idea that you could divide water and call it 'border' was too ridiculous to even laugh at.
