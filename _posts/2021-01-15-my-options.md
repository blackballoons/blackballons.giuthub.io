though the journey not all rosy  
many months gone already  
all I have to show is  
precious few, meaning none  


reading-up or lounging  
running or binging  
nothing much except the world in misery  

desperate and lazy such sinful combination  
same options but older  
harried, jagged and bare  


working for company  
(remote or otherwise)  
copy writing or translating  
making up words in broad daylight  


giving myself more days  
a questionable notion  
but hope to make options  
because waiting for Godot is not a solution
