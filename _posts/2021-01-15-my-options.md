though the journey not rosy  
many months passed per custom (no discount)  
reading-up or lounging  
running or binging  
nothing changed except  
the world still in misery  


desperate and lazy  
such sinful combination  
precious few, meaning none  
is all I have to show for  

dreadful to crawl back  
to same escape hatches   
harried, jagged and cowered  
working for a company  
(remote or otherwise)  
copy writing or translating  
making up non-meaning in broad daylight  

just hoping to make options   
pretty questionable notion    
because waiting for Godot  
(who would have known) is not a solution
