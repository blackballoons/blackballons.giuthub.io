## My Options

though the journey not all rosy
many months gone already
all I have to show is
precious few, meaning none

reading-up or lounging
running or binging
nothing much except the world in misery

same options but older
harried, jagged and bare

working for company
(remote or otherwise)
copy writing or translating
making up words in broad daylight

give myself more days
questionable notion
hope to make options
how come desperate and lazy
