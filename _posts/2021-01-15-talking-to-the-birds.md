## Talking to birds

### Jonathan

  Jonathan flew over without stopping to say hello.
  "Did he read that post I wrote about seagulls and their culture of deviancy?"
  It's unfair because there is no way I could have known his family was mentioned in the quotes.
  I feel(I'm sure he knows this too) that there is a huge difference between snub with a beak and slap on the wing; and this time, Jonathan was flying straight over that line.


### Artificial Kind

The kite turned back and stood against the wind. The eyes drawn on its back seem to look straight at us. "What's happening?" my brother's voice was shaking and I felt my throat closing up. I wished I hadn't coated the string with glass.


## Talking to myself

Insert acrimonious rant
