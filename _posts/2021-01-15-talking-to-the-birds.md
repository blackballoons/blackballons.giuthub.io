# Talking to Birds

## Jonathan

  Jonathan flew over without stopping to say hello.
  "Did he read a commentary I wrote about seagulls and their culture of deviancy?"
  It's unfair because there is no way I could have known his family was mentioned in one of the quotes.
  I feel(and I know he is aware of it too) that there is a huge difference between snub with a beak and slap on the wing; and this time, I saw Jonathan flew straight over that line.


## Artifical Kind

The kite turned back and stood against the prevailing wind. The eyes drawn on its back seem to look straight at us. "What's happening?" there was my brother's voice was shaking and I felt my throat closing up. I wished I hadn't coated the string with glass.

# Talking to myself

## My options

precious few
working for company (remote or otherwise)
copy writing or translating

## Anger moment - Unbearable, unforgivable country and population

I've never liked people anywhere anytime. But people here, so many of them, in fact majority of them are incredible in their selfishness, stupidity, calousness and just general horrendousness. Just the sight of them makes my blood boil and my sanity is hanging by a thread. I was flabagasted for good while, curious for some time but now I'm just angry. Angry and depressed that I'm stuck with this incredible race of stupid, selfish, doomed people.

## talking down to myself

no sympathy. what have I become? hatred and anger is a scary thing that change you from inside out. It doesn't take much to become something like a monster if you have much anger and no sympathy.

# How it's going

Trying to remind myself not to dwell on the past and to face the future and be brave and smart.
