## Talking to birds

### Jonathan

  Jonathan flew over without stopping to say hello.
  "Did he read that post I wrote about seagulls and their culture of deviancy?"
  It's unfair because there is no way I could have known his family was mentioned in one of the quotes.
  I feel(and I'm sure he knows this too) that there is a huge difference between snub with a beak and slap on the wing; and this time, Jonathan was flying straight over that line.


### Artificial Kind

The kite turned back and stood against the wind. The eyes drawn on its back seem to look straight at us. "What's happening?" my brother's voice was shaking and I felt my throat closing up. I wished I hadn't coated the string with glass.


## Talking to myself


### Simmering to boiling

I've never liked people anywhere anytime. But people here, the majority of them are incredible in their selfishness, stupidity, callousness and just general horrendousness. Just the sight of them makes my blood boil and fraying my sanity even further. I was flabbergasted for good while, curious for some time, but now I'm just angry. Angry and depressed that I'm stuck with this incredible race of stupid, selfish, forsaken people.

### Talking down to myself

no sympathy. what have I become? hatred and anger is a scary thing that changes one from inside out. It doesn't take much to become a monster if I start mixing up much anger and no sympathy.

Trying to remind myself not to dwell on the past and to face the future and be brave and smart.
