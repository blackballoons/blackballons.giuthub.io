woke up early  
which was good  
didn't go running  
which is the worst    

snappy to partner  
where is my mood    
made him a cuppa  
I can't be that bad    

the room with a view  
(of the grey sky)  
dank moist shady  
course its raining

have some cuppa  
its called osmosis  
anxiety running      
am I doomed already?  

betray me betray yourself  
got to start well (or otherwise)  

complaint more  
I would drown indoor   
just do it and be miserable (but better)  


get out and start  
and don't stop running  
the answer is obvious  
(and there is no reveal)  

thriving for me is the only option  


ps. got to something else than hating on people
