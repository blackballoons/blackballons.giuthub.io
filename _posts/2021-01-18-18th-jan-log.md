woke up early  
(which was good)  
didn't go running  
(which is the worst)    

snappy to partner  
(where is my mood)    
made him a cuppa  
(I can't be that bad)    

the room with a view  
(of the grey sky)  
dank moist shady  
(course its raining)

have some cuppa  
(its called osmosis)  
anxiety running  
(am I doomed already?)  

betray me betray yourself  
got to start well  
(or otherwise)  
complaint more I'd drown indoor   
just do it and better  
(miserable but better)  


get out, start and don't stop running  
the answer is obvious  
thriving is the only option
