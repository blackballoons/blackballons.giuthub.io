In this great land of the grey   
where the sun is a rumor  
and the sky corpse colour  


a soothsayer might say  
imagine there's no people  
a tall order for the spirit expired   


In this great land of the past    
crowd roams as if nothing going    
nary a soul died on this soil coughing  


without mask without care  
have pickled brain with sour snout  
with hatred baked in resentment  
I feel right at home biding for escape
