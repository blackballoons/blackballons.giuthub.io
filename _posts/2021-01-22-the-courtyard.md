Due to future being unforseeable and me being idiotic, this winter of more-than-just-discontent I found myself in Bath, England. Having spent the previous month in a rat infested flat in Seoul, I would have been grateful of any roof over my head that is not a rat racetrack; but I lucked out with a classy Georgian house with high windows overlooking a courtyard.

## The Tree

The most impressive about the courtyard is a giant plain tree. It is a fantastic focal point that performs the role of a 200 years old water cooler. Birds, people and dogs are naturally attracted to it. And when the sun shine on it after rain, the branches turn into a beautiful chandelier.  

## People

In addition to the tree, in the courtyard there's always a constant stream of people. I feel no compunction about watching people over the windows (the only downside being people looking up to me). There is less traffic now with a lock-down, but since the courtyard is so close to Bath Abbey (another magnificent one), I still get to survey plenty of people and dogs.

## Watching

Watching people, I found, is a meditative activity. I notice where my thoughts are headed by the narratives I come up with people I'm watching. For example, sometimes the most ordinary scene impresses me.

> A father and son walking. The son running to the tree. The father calling the boy's name. The son running back towards him.

Watching the scene above without a context, it seemed like a magic, like an incantation for bringing back what's precious to you.
