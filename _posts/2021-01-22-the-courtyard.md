My current aboard has large windows overlooking a courtyard with a giant plain tree. The tree is an impressive specimen with over two hundreds years of history under its trunk. Little song birds love its fruits; and when there's sun after the rain, the branches with rain drops transform into a gorgeous chandelier.  

In addition to the magnificent tree, the courtyard also provides constant stream of people to watch. I feel no compunction about watching people over the window (ironically, the only downside is people looking up to me which is little unnerving). There is less traffic now with lock-down, but since the courtyard is so close to Bath Abbey (another magnificent one), there are still enough people and dogs to survey.

Watching people, I found, is a rather meditative activity. I notice where my thoughts are headed by the narratives I create for people I'm watching. For example, sometimes the most ordinary scene like the following tableau impresses me.
> A father and son walking. The son running to the tree. The father calling the boy's name. The son running back towards him.

Maybe someone calling the other's name, and the other coming back to the caller is the most normal thing in the world. But watching the duo without a context, it seemed like a magic, an incantation for bringing back what's precious to you.  

Another interesting scene today was of a solitary guy and how he attracted people. A young guy was standing in front of a closed pub with his camera and a stand. I couldn't figure out what he was filming, but I noticed that it wasn't just me that found him intriguing. Several people stopped to talk to the guy (since I can't hear them, I'm assuming they were asking what he was doing). Just standing with a camera, which is a common object, was enough to engage people's curiosity. And it was interesting to me that so many people wanted to fill in the backstory of the guy(maybe I'm projecting too much).
