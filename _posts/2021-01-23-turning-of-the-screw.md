I can't recall what the scene was about, but I do remember that Reese Witherspoon screwed the cap all the way in.
I guess she was drinking in the scene; and she must have unscrewed the bottle - poured a drink - and screw the top back on (bear with me).  
My team of researchers tells me that the minimum action required to consume a liquid is to open(unscrew) a container, get the liquid out and into your system; you can be fancy about it and pour the drink into a cup, or save environment by drinking straight from the bottle. And if we were to focus purely on the efficiency (especially if the event is set in a tv show where accidents only conceived by writers are allowed to happen) you don't have to screw the cap all the way back in.

*But would that seat OK with you?*

My theory is that Reese Withersppon wouldn't have been OK with it. And possibly quite sizable number of audience would have been driven mad by the presence of an open bottle. Because, doesn't matter who you are, as long as you are a 'grown-up', meaning someone who understands the meaning of 'consequences', you *always screw the bottle all the way in*.  
That's why I would be distracted by an open bottle, and shout at a screen "look at the road!" if a driver is talking in a *tv show*.  
Because when you've suffered enough consequences, fear of real-life consequences becomes a knee-jerk response. And weather I like it or not I think that's when a person is *fully grown*.
