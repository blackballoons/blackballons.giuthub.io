I can't recall what the scene was about, but I do remember that Reese Witherspoon screwed the cap all the way in.
I guess she was drinking in the scene; and she must have unscrewed the bottle - poured a drink - and screw the top back on (bear with me).  
Using my intelligence, I've deduced that the minimum action required to have a drink is to open(unscrew) a bottle and get the liquid out and into your system; you can be fancy about it and pour the drink into a cup, or save washing liquid by drinking straight from the bottle. But purely for the time saving perspective (especially in the la-la land where all accident has to be conceived by writers) you don't have to screw the cap all the way back in.  
But would that seat OK with you?
My theory is that Reese Withersppon wouldn't have been OK with it. And quite possibly sizable number of audience would have been driven mad by the presence of an open bottle. Because, doesn't matter how old you are, if you are a 'grown-up', meaning someone who understands the meaning of 'consequences' you *always screw your bottle all the way in*.  
That's why you would be distracted by an open bottle, and can't watch without shouting at screen "look at the road!"" if the driver is talking in a *tv show*. Because when you've suffered enough consequences, fearing real-life consequences becomes as ingrained as a knee-jerk response. And I think that's when a person is *fully grown*.
