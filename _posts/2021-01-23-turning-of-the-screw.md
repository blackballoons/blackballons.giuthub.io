I can't recall what the scene was about, but I do remember Reese Witherspoon screwed the cap all the way in.
I guess she was drinking in the scene; and she must have unscrewed the bottle - poured a drink - and screw the top back on (bear with me).  
My team of researchers tells me that the minimum action required to consume a liquid is to open(unscrew) a container, get the liquid out, and into your system. You can be fancy about it and pour the drink into a cup, or save environment by drinking straight from the bottle. But in any case, what is not strictly required (especially if the event is set in a tv show) is screwing the cap *all* the way back in.

*But how would that make us feel?*

My theory is that Reese Withersppon wouldn't have been OK with it. And possibly quite sizable number of audience would have been driven mad by the presence of an open bottle.  
Because that is not how we do things in real life. As long as you understand the meaning of 'consequence', you always screw the bottle *all* the way in.  
And I think that is why many among us would be distracted by an open bottle, and shout at a screen "look at the road!" if a driver is talking in a *tv show*.  Because when you have suffered enough consequences, fear of real-life consequences becomes a knee-jerk response.
