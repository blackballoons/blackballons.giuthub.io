I was about to solipsize about how crystallized ginger is my kryptonite. Then I realized  I'd already given the title to mint humbug. And.. I said something similar about Lindt 70% dark chocolate before, as well as ginger bread, mince pie, chocolate pudding...

The truth is, the world is bedazzled with kryptonites, which says more about myself than the world's composition. Maybe it is a testament to my resilience, subjecting myself to frequent kryptonite exposure as such. Or it denotes my bon vivant nature. It is also possible that I need to schedule an appointment with the dentist asap.
