Oh there you are, dear. I have something to tell you. There is a mystery afoot in our courtyard.  
Do you see that green shop?  

 *What do you mean what do I mean by the green shop? Look out the window, there is only one green shop.  No, I'm not angry; and this IS my normal volume. Anyway that is not the point. Yes! I am doing an accent. Yes, I was trying to do a bit. And you've ruined it. No, drop it. It's gone now. you always do this.... OK, I'm doing it now. Commencing a bit...*  

Yes, dear that is the green shop.  
We have passed it multiple times, and even went in to see their wear once. Because from the outside, there is no telling what they sell if they sell anything at all! And it was a shirty little operation with a lady who looked as if life had cheated on her, but she never really cared anyway. They were selling chachkies and only thing unique about them is that they don't sell them cheap.

So by all account, that shop is exactly the type of establishment that has no business existing in the first place not to mention attracting local (not tourists mind you) as much as they do. Even when they are not open, you can see people looking into the window ever so often. Like I said, something's going on...

*No, I don't think they are selling anything illegal. Yes, I have listened to that podcast yesterday, but this has nothing to do with it. Can't you for once just let me do my thing now?*

Do you remember the tale of red-headed society? OK... The Red-headed League if you are being pedantic. I think maybe something akin to that gingery gathering is going on there. Because if you recall on the other side of the shop is a bank...

*That's it. I give up. It could have been fun. Why don't we ever do something fun? I'm gonna watch YouTube now so don't talk to me*
