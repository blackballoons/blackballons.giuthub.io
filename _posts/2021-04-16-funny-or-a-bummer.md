This looks bad...  

    
the word 약 (pronounced Yak) within the phrase 강**약**조절 is a homonym that means either medication or weak. It is one of many Korean words with roots in Chinese vocabs (the traditional Chinese letter is 藥, pronounced yào in Chinese). And I'm guessing and hoping the bike maker was trying to say Weak instead of Drug in this case; but Google translate for its infinite wisdom pulled a fast one on them, and yes, it's a good one. However, what isn't quite funny is that better translation isn't *strong weak control* in the first place. Maybe Power Control or Difficulty Control would do so they can indicate Easy to Difficult.

Let me pontificate (please let me), language is borne of culture and culture is borne of many sub cultures. When you translate, you are not just speaking the language of 'English speaking people'. That's *waaaayyy* too big of a group to speak to. You need to know your audience and what kind of language they speak in their group. In this case, it would be the language of exercise machine they should be speaking. I apologize for being a bummer pointing out the bigger translation issue instead of putting my time to good use and make a meme or two for this GT gold, but whomever just stuck GT on their machine without reading it first should do too.
