A man passed middle age but not really old, passed by my window with an orange saw.
Not energetic, not tired, purposeful and comfortingly ordinary. An orange saw makes him more visible and fun. Why does it matter that it is a saw? It doesn't. He walks and he works. He is doing well and my window is filled with everything out there as always.
