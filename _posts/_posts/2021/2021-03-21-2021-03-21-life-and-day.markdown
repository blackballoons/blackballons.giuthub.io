It's not fate. We are *fated* by our own strength.
It is not because of the destiny that we end up where we started, we are *destined* in a sense that being overcame by exhaustion is worse than death. We find peace in where we end up or conveniently forget where we came from. If successful, we will redefine our station. If not we will become a better liar.
