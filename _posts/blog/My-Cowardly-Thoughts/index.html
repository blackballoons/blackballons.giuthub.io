<p>The light came on the screen, my thoughts scurried in fright.
My thoughtsâ€™ craven and cowardly flight should have been forseen, since it was a norm by this point, but it still stung and this time it felt particularly like a betrayal because I had an impression that my thought and I had been through something significant during the last horrendous week.
So my thoughts running away as if in denial of that experience if not my existence felt very much like a betrayal and hurt my feeling a great deal.</p>

<p>I have realize pretty early that my thoughts love the darkness, which is why they becomes extraordinarily loud and bold when I shut my eyes to sleep. It also matters that they are quite often the festering kinds. Since light stops the unhealthy growth of my thoughts, they are not keen on the exposure.
So when I open my laptop and the light from the screen passes the retinas of my eyes my thoughts scatter and scrum to the backwater of my skull.</p>
