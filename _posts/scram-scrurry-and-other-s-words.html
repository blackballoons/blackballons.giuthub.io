<div id="content"><p>As my laptop came into life and the screen light shone on my thoughts scurried in fright.<br />
There was nothing unusual about this annoying ritual, but this time it felt particularly like a betrayal because I had an impression that my thought and I had reached a pretty significant life lesson during the last horrendous week.<br />
So my thoughts running away as if in denial of my experience if not my existence hurt my feeling a great deal. </p>

<p>my thoughts love the darkness, that's why it becomes extraordinarily loud and bold when I shut my eyes to sleep. I think it also doesn't like light because quite many of them are the festering kinds. Light stops the growth of festering thoughts and they are not on board with that.<br />
So when I open my laptop and the light from the screen passes the retinas of my eyes my thoughts scatter like uninvited guests they are. </p>
