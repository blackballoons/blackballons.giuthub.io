Had a quite long run. listended to all five episodes of How to fuck up an airport podcast. 

Saw tunnel of blazing sunshine, sparkling fields of frost and ice, Chalfield Manor and all encompasing view of Bath and Bathampton. 

Came back pretty tired. The day was still nice and bright (stayed that way most of the day 2020 trying to make it up in its way). 

Had a short bath and some snacks. I'm still quite tired but since I came back rather late from the run the rest of the day could not but be little short. B is steating next to me distracted/distracting?
