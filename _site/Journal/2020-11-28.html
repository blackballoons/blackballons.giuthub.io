      <p>Slept little bad (woke up to pee and couldn’t go back to sleep easily. so read Utopian Avenue which is pretty good I’m enjoying it). Today the air is pretty good and pretty sunny. So although it was chilly and me a bit tired I had a good run. And I’m very glad for that run. I intend to keep on doing that route everyday at least till the day before our departure date. 
I also intend to go the running meetup tomorrow. I should see the people and I want to as well.</p>

<p>I had some interesting thoughts on what kind of opportunity would exist due to VR and especially what that might mean for creative industry, so I wrote about it bit in [[VR and Creative Industry]]. I think to maybe in a favorable position when those kinds of opportunity arise is to know more about the language of future, by which I mean programming language. So as I wrote yesterday, beginning from today I would study programming about 2 hrs a day, and do human language (Spanish) about the same duration.</p>

<p>I think for way things are headed, I might be as free as a bird in a storm for about 5 to 6 months, traveling here and there. So if I use that time wisely I might come off with several languages that might come very useful when I would really need some monetizable skills. What’s important now, since I have marginally clearer idea about how to go about (although what is still unclear), would be putting the plans into practice and be keep at it. Like running, the key is to start running and not stopping it.</p>

<p>It is a bit shocking to realize that it already has been 4 months since I quite my job. It really is about time that I start being constructive about the future.</p>

<p>My mantra : running, learning, reading and writing still very much stands. Even after years I still find it true.</p>

<p>5pm 
went out and had a really nice lunch with B. walked around the different part of the neighborhood, one of those fancy diplomatic community area, it was pretty lovely if not bit intimidating. we also bought and brought back some nice bread. Proper winter jaunt with complete with crisp air, good food and humor. 
Came back and finished the first ch of the Python tutorial I was watching and a bit more. Quite pleased with the initiation, the challenge is to keep at it I’m sure.</p>

<p>also, to note, I’m aware that I’m in the habit of eating whist eating sometimes (especial with the screen on) I should practice stop doing that.</p>
