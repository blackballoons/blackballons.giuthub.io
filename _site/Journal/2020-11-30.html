      <p>I’m so far enjoying this note app.</p>

<p>Had a good morning run. Although I was tired the moon, nightscape and the sunrise were very beautiful and the podcast I was listening to were interesting. 
I also thought about how constructive and pleasant it is and would be to focus more on the positives. 
Came back, took a shower, talked to B. had some breakfast.</p>

<p>B said something about <em>‘beginning to see the outline of the life I’m interested in’</em>  I really liked how he phrased it and the sentiment behind it.</p>

<p>I’m continuing to watch and learn about python. I’m very pleased with the introduction of this new line of studying and occupying. I think it is good direction and feel more determined. 
I also made an appointment with the dentist. Doing something I have been postponing also made me feel better.</p>

<p>finished quite view videos. feel good about it. was snacking as I was watching it but since we didn’t have a seat down proper meal today, this doesn’t feel much disordered.</p>

<p>the destination and the schedule of the next trip is set now. going to bath. also set the date for meeting up with mum. 
at least it’s gonna be interesting. 
b is struggling a bit with the chair situation. when we come back to Korea we will start making long term arrangement and that will be fun.</p>

<p>I still think about now and then I might be fully in the stable ground, but rather than thinking about what might go wrong knowing that I am capable of bouncing back and that I’m resilient.</p>
