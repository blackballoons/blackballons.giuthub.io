      <p>conditions are not same as causation. 
evolutionary process (self guiding process)</p>

<p>had a great run with interesting cityscape. listened to some interesting episodes. 
especially Sean exploder was pretty lovely and along with the story about Percy Shell the inventor of cat’s eyes and the guy in Postal service inventing mail box and all the other design process made me think about the evolutionary process addressing the problem that is our lives.</p>

<p>Watched some python videos. I am little less enthusiastic about the particular video now but it makes sense because I’m at the end of this particular section and it is a bit grindy. But I still enjoyed it. As a distraction ( I think this might work as a routine as well) I read some articles in Spanish and that was good. I also checked my domain (which last until the next year and realized that I have redirrected my website to git repository and uploaded my cv there and there was my phone number all exposed in it! I have fixed that cv but didn’t take down the cv itself. Don’t think it would cause any problem for now.)
Went out and have a really nice bugger. B is in a bit of a rut now. I feel bad for him and also feel that I feel resentful of his bad patch. I recognized that this is unfair because he has been exceptionally supportive when I was in a rut.</p>

<p>I was hungry now and then during this year. It just that I wanted to have a good appetite when we went out for a meal and when we weren’t going out, I was eating simple stuff and portioning them throughout. 
I am not quite sure if anything about that is particularly bad. But today I felt a bit of temptation to eat more disorderly so I will try to monitor hunger better and especially not let it go haywire to the point that it becomes difficult to recognize weather or not if I’m full.</p>

<p>Also it needs to be checked if I’m not conditioning myself to snack as I study. because that will not be a productive association to have. Today as I was watching the tutorial I felt a hankering to keep snacking and I don’t think it is conducive to good learning nor good fueling.</p>

<p>The way I feel I see B having a less productive day is maybe something to be considered. Maybe I project. Or the anxiety and fear about my own self management I put upon B. Blaming him and relegating responsibility. [CBT]</p>

<p>B is in a bit of a rut</p>
