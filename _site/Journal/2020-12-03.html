      <p>I had a great run. I wasn’t very enthusiastic to say the least but went out and had a good run. The sun, the moon and the city really is beautiful and makes everything worth it.</p>

<p>I’m keep snacking but I don’t really want to eat any particular thing even the burger (maybe I do but not enough to justify it).</p>

<h4 id="negative-affect">Negative affect</h4>
<p>I feel not so affectionate towards B and easily annoyed by him. I feel as if I want to cry. Don’t quite know why. I need to think about it. I should and would go for a walk now.</p>

<p>I just got some carrots and came back. B is annoyed at me for an offense that wasn’t meant. Got stuck with the tutorial and watched some other videos. Now transfering drag race to the phone to watch. Wander what got into me. had some boiled eggs and carrots. lots of almond milk. It’s not too bad for orderly eating wise but still quite bummed out. I want to figure out what’s up.</p>

<p>So today, the way I felt (imagined myself to feel) is that of course I wanted something nice to eat but didn’t nor wanted anything particular. So I had some usual sweet potatoes which turned out not so nice. apples not so nice. But the eggs were nice and carrots not too bad. And some muslie as well. almond milk torelable. So those are what I had and I didn’t have that in small amount I’m afraid. To be clear, don’t think anything was particularly bad.</p>
