# Best Run
two tunnel section of the route was amazing! also the canal road was great. 


# CBT
tempted to lash out and be unpleasant by saying ur gov is doing shit job. But that would be more to blame him for something that isn't his fault. this can be reframed as we are spending holidays (Christmas eve and Christmas with the family. The day is gonna be nice. I got really good run in today. If needs be I just got headlamp for running in the dark so that can be arranged.) I'm feeling sleepy and tired but that is no reason ever to be not my best self.

## [Culpable control and the psychology of blame.]

Alicke, M. D. (2000). Culpable control and the psychology of blame. _Psychological Bulletin, 126_(4), 556–574. [https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.126.4.556](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0033-2909.126.4.556)

A culpable control model is advanced to describe the conditions that encourage as well as mitigate blame and to assess the process by which blame and mitigation occur. **The fundamental assumptions of the model are that evidence concerning harmful events is scrutinized for its contribution to personal control and spontaneously evaluated for its favorableness or unfavorableness.** Spontaneous evaluations encourage a blame–validation mode of processing in which evidence concerning the event is reviewed in a manner that favors ascribing blame to the person or persons who evoke the most negative affect or whose behavior confirms unfavorable expectations. The author delineates the elements of perceived control and then discusses spontaneous evaluation influences on control and blame assessments. The blame–validation process is described next. Finally, the culpable control model is compared with extant theories of blame and responsibility and its basic tenets summarized. (APA PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
