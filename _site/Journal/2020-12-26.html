<p>great run. food. snack. sight. things are good. start to feel motivated about the job</p>

<p>start to feel worried but that would be great source of motivation. with 2021 beginning I could step up for the better future. stress is often gonna be a part of the change but since change is gonna be part of life I might as well take it in the best attitude and run with it as a great source of motivation to better myself and my lot.</p>

<p>Another great edition from Bath. It was a chilly rainy day as prophesied and assumed by everyone. Started the journey with Louix Threou podcast Ruby Wax interview. It was a weird and interesting one as per. The canal was scenic and the wood burning smell comforting, the run felt cozy and loungy; but then I started listening the latest episode of This American Life, which had a story about firefighting. The coziness of the smoke took some complexity from then. Initially, I intended to run along the canal as much as I can but monotony woke up tiredness a bit so I diverted to Monkton Comb which is a quaint and posh little village. Passing by the village I moved on to a different cycle path and passed by Midport station and Midport castle. Both disused and interesting. Then I saw a bull finch which Iâ€™ve never seen before. Things were getting exciting. Then I reached my favorite point, the tunnel. I had my playlist ready.</p>
