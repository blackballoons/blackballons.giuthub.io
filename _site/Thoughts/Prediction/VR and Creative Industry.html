      <h3 id="bigger-picture">Bigger Picture</h3>
<p>The history of economic growth is mainly a story of scaling up. Creating bigger and bigger cooperative groups to create a bigger and bigger pie. 
The size of cooperative group has increased from tribal to national then international. Alongside this scaling up of economic network, the organizational unit has also seen evolved from tribe to nation state then multinational cooperation. 
IMHO before the rise of internet, multinational corporation and nation state has coexist fairly well mainly due to the fact that the operation of corporations were reliant on the infrastructure that belong to states including the media. However, with the internet, the extent of corporationâ€™s reach is more pervasive and persistent enabling them to achieve its true potential as international units of cooperative organization. 
So, as we are entering what seems to be the introduction of VR technology to mainstream utilization, I wonder, how would VR, as the new pivotal introduction after the internet change the dynamic between state and corporations (that is <em>if</em> they remain to be the two main entities governing the world and every day life of people)?</p>

<h3 id="opportunity">Opportunity</h3>
<p>The many enterprises users created within the universe of games such as Sims like would be created again but with full-on mass market potential. 
what interests me most is the commercial #potential this might have for #artists.</p>

<h4 id="creative-market-with-vr">Creative Market with VR</h4>
<p>I think currently artists very limited way of commercialize their creation. Only some musicians, actors, and writers have found way to commercialize their talent by scaling up their production massively with the help of media. Visual artists and the most artists have that can not reach audience in realistic scale has little to no way of commercializing their creation.
However with VR, it would be much affordable for ordinary consumer to commission, buy, and store paintings, hire musicians to perform virtual concert, commission writings, plays or any kind of production. The question remains for Digital Rights Management and to assure the scarcity of the production.</p>

<h4 id="other-opportunities-with-vrar">Other opportunities with VR/AR</h4>
<p>There are much potentials that I can even think of atm in VR/AR. With AR, teaching, tutoring, therapy (physical, psychological)</p>

<h4 id="still-relevant">Still relevant</h4>
<ul>
  <li>communication skill (most importantly language) 
As VR would open more opportunity for people to connect with others, communication skill would still be very important. Machine translation is good but until we can create true AI that can replicate human brain(which would be far off if ever) I predict flawless translations would still be the realms of human translation.</li>
  <li>Time 
with the internet and VR/AR the space would be less of a limiting factor but time would still govern arrangements of any events</li>
</ul>
